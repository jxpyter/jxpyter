### 👨‍💻 SaaS Engineer | Database Administrator | Security-First Development

"Welcome. Or don't stay. It makes no difference to me.<br>

Code is cheap; logic is expensive. While the masses struggle with frameworks they barely understand, I architect scalable integrity and absolute security. To me, complexity isn't a feature—it’s a failure of intelligence.
My systems are secure by design, not by accident. The work below represents my will; try to keep up, if you can even decode the intent behind it."
